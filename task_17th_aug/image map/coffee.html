    <p>A coffee cup is a container, a cup, for serving coffee and coffee-based drinks. There are three major types: conventional cups used with saucers, mugs used without saucers, and disposable cups. Cups and mugs generally have a handle. Disposable paper cups used for take-out sometimes have fold-out handles, but are more often used with an insulating coffee cup sleeve.

        Coffee cups and mugs may be made of glazed ceramic, porcelain, plastic, glass, insulated or uninsulated metal, and other materials. In the past, coffee cups have also been made of bone, clay, and wood.[1] Disposable coffee cups may be made out of paper or polystyrene foam (often mistakenly called Styrofoam).
        Coffee cups, along with other coffee ware, originated in the Middle East. In the 17th century, coffee was consumed from small handle-less bowls, "Turkish cups". The cups were manufactured in Japan and China; the same cups were frequently intended for coffee and tea. In Europe, Meissen porcelain cups appeared around 1710,[2]: 230  with large exports of "Turkish cups" to Turkey in the 1730s. These cups were tall due to the habit of drinking the liquid layer at the top, with the preparation sediment left at the bottom. As the drip coffee, invented in France in the 18th century, gained popularity, the need for tall cups disappeared, so the Sèvres porcelain signature cups were short.[2]: 232 

        The porcelain handles first appeared on the Meissen tall cups in the 1710s (some Oriental cups had handles, but these were made from silver). Handles became common by the 1730s.[2]: 232 </p>
