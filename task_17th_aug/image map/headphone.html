    <p>Coffee cups, along with other coffee ware, originated in the Middle East. In the 17th century, coffee was consumed from small handle-less bowls, "Turkish cups". The cups were manufactured in Japan and China; the same cups were frequently intended for coffee and tea. In Europe, Meissen porcelain cups appeared around 1710,[2]: 230  with large exports of "Turkish cups" to Turkey in the 1730s. These cups were tall due to the habit of drinking the liquid layer at the top, with the preparation sediment left at the bottom. As the drip coffee, invented in France in the 18th century, gained popularity, the need for tall cups disappeared, so the Sèvres porcelain signature cups were short.[2]: 232 

        The porcelain handles first appeared on the Meissen tall cups in the 1710s (some Oriental cups had handles, but these were made from silver). Handles became common by the 1730s.[2]: 232 Working of Headphones
        Lets try to understand the science behind the working of headphones in some simple points
        
        As we know headphone contains speaker connected with wires and plug connected with the sound source, so at first the sound source send the sound in form of an electric signal basically the signals have all the data about waveform’s amplitude, pitch voice, pitch speech or music then this electric signal will travel through wires.
        Then these signals splits into parts usually two, we know we have two speakers in headphones and we need sound in both so we made it the way that it equally divides electric signals.
        Finally these signal reaches headphone cups, they contain speaker drivers which will be used to convert over electric signals in sound form. So how does it convert? Speaker drivers mainly have three parts which are diaphragm, voice coil, and magnet.
        Diaphragm: Its a thin flexible membrane, its main task is to vibrate when any electric signal passes through voice coil and these vibrations will cause change in air pressure which will create sound waves.
        Voice Coil: The voice coil is a wire coil attached to the back of the diaphragm. It is positioned within the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. When the electrical signal passes through the voice coil, it generates a magnetic field that interacts with the permanent magnet, causing the voice coil and diaphragm to move back and forth.
        So due to this movement, the air gets pushed and pulled the air pressure changes due to this movement sound is produced which enters our ear and we hear sound.
        Types of Headphones
        There are many different types of headphones which have there own advantages and disadvantages lets see what are most commonly used headphone types :
        
        In-ear headphones: We can fit these inside our ear canals that’s why they are known as in ear headphones. They are smaller and compact in size and provides a good sound quality they don’t leak any sound because they are very close to ear and also very small.
        On-ear headphones: They are worn on the outer ear. They are also known by name supra aural headphones.. They are larger than in-ear headphones, but smaller than over-ear headphones. They can offer decent sound quality and comfort, but they may also leak sound to the outside or let in ambient noise.
        Over-ear headphones: These are headphones that cover your entire ear. We also call them as circumoral headphones or full-size headphones. They are largest as compared to any other types of headphones and because of largeness they are heavier also. They are best in almost all aspects such as sound quality, and other additional features but problem with them are that they are bulky and get heat soon. They are easily visible to other person looking at us.</p>
